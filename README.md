Welcome to 'Presto!',  our General Assembly Web Development Immersive team project!

'Presto!' is a content management system for companies and organizations that want to have their own company blog and web page. The users need to be able to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) their entries.  Vistitors can come to the 'Presto!' site and view the content that has been created for one or many companies.

'Presto!' is a SPA (Single Page App).  To build it we needed to collaboratively build an API in Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB.  The front-end was built in Javascript, HTML5, and CSS3.

Working as a team and using version control by sharing our work to repositories hosted on GitHub was a great opportunity to collaborate in a way that is similar to what it will be like to work on a team in the workplace.  Throughout the course of the project we met twice a day to do 'Stand Ups' and to plan our workflow.

We began our project by creating the ERD's, user stories, and wireframes.  We worked individually to start and then reconvened at the whiteboard to clarify and adjust our plans.  We decided to get the API code functioning prior to moving on to the front-end.

Throughout the course of the project we made sure that each of us had an opportunity to work on both the front end and the back end.

'PRESTO!' FEATURES:

RESTful Routes (paths and methods) including:

Users must be able to sign-up, sign-out, sign-in, and change their password.

Changes to blogs and pages require authentication and ownership by the user.

The code is attentively commented out.

Apart from MVP (MInimum Viable Product) requirements we

Given the very tight time frame (one week!) of producing a functional web application there are some features we might have approached differently:
Our first ERD had the logo listed under the 'Blog'. We subsequently realized it would have made more sense for it to belong to the User/Company. 
We would love to be able to search the blogs.
